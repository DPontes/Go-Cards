# Cards Game in Golang

The code is for the Cards project, first project from the Udemy course [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/)

## Notes

- The fact that the cards are a string concatenation of their suit and value makes it harder to assertain their value or suit separately without more convoluted string manipulation. The use of Â´structs` would be a good idea here.
